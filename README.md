<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this application is to find and display the solution for a given initial state, which consists of a number of beakers that are filled with mixed colored liquids. The desired state (solution) would have all beakers containing only liquids of a single color. The solution (if it exists) is to be determined by using the A* algorithm.

It provides functionalities such as:
* adding as many beakers and color samples as needed
* filling beakers to up to 10 colors
* picking custom color shades
* dragging and dropping colors from the color shade list, or from the beaker contents themselves
* simple UI that displays step-by-step how to reach the solution for the given combination
